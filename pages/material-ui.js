          <h1 className="h1">Hello Olivier and team! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
          <h2 className="paragraph-1 mb-3">
            First of all, I wanted to thank you for the opportunity of applying
            to be a part of your team. All conversations I had with Olivier were
            very nice, it was a pleasure getting to know you!
            <br />
            <br />
            My train of thought for this exercise was trying to come up with the
            ultimate problem MaterialUI as a company is trying to solve. From my
            day-to-day experience with the library in a huge company context,
            I'm inclined to believe that MaterialUI is the ultimate UI solution
            for anyone. If you think about the product kit as a whole, it's
            ultimately letting developers not worry anymore with UI building.
            <br />
            <br />
            The only product I left out is the Builder. My understanding,
            especially after talking to Olivier, is that this product is still
            not making much sense in the company portfolio. I really like the
            idea and believe that it has huge potential, though.
            <br />
            <br />
            I've built on top of the "building blocks" concept. The Material-UI
            product set solves problems for a broad range of needs: from
            experienced developers trying to build complex systems UIs to
            iterative designers and product people trying to get MVPs off of the
            ground.

                    designed in the desktop breakpoint.

                    For getting a feeling of how this would play out if it were
