              a tradable good in a too capitalistic environment. A product is
              the packaged result of someone's take in some problem. And I like
              to design good products. Good not only for me, of course, but to
              whom else will consume it, use it and enjoy it. There's so much in
              order to do that, from strategy to deployment. I'm someone who
              dives real deep in every step, from research to shaping it out.
              And I nerd it out in all of them."
